# Boulder Dash
This project is my own clone of Boulder Dash which I've created for learning purposes. It's written in C++ using SFML. The engine is fully done by me, but all the resources come from www.bd-fans.com. 

The original game was released in 1984 and gained enormous popularity that resulted in numerous remakes. This project isn't an exact copy. I've taken what I liked the most in the original version and added some improvements such as fluent movement of objects or the possibility of two objects to partly cover the same field. In my opinion it makes the game more enjoyable. In the video below you can see the gameplay.

## Requirements
If you want to build the project from source, apart from the C++ compiler, you'll need to have following tools installed:
* CMake
* Make
* SFML ([download](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/))

## Compilation
First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/sgol13/boulder-dash.git
cd boulder-dash
```

Then you can compile and run the game by using a prepared bash script. Just type:
```
./run
```
